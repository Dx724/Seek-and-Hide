"Always stay six feet apart." That's the maxim echoed around the world these days. In such isolation, it's difficult to play games such as hide-and-seek or tag with your friends. However, the Seek and Hide aims to capture the joy of such games via distance in time rather than space.

A player connects to the device via Wi-Fi and is guided by a virtual personality with chats with, taunts, and encourages the player to find it. The device senses when the user is in the general area, passes directly by, or is completely lost. Using such information, the virtual personality will tactically jeer at the seeker until it is found.

Once the player finds the Seek and Hide, it's time to hide! The player moves the device to a new location and configures its difficulty, setting up a challenge for the next player and coming to the realization that their own journey was the design of some player prior.
